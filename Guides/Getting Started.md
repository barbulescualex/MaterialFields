# Getting Started

Getting started with MaterialFields is very easy! There are 2 example projects, one programmatic and one using storyboards showing you the implementation.

You can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/barbulescualex/MaterialFields)

Essentially there are only 4 things you need to do to get the basic functionality going:

1. Instantiate the field
2. Set its placeholder (this is the title label) and data array (if PickerField)
3. Set its delegate
4. Implement the didEndEditing delegate method to get the value when the users done!

You should start by looking at the guide for the [Field](https://barbulescualex.github.io/MaterialFields/field.html) class. This is the class that all the field components subclass.
